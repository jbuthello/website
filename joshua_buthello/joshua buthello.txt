Respected Sir,
I've tried my best to create the given sample website, using simple fundamental basic concepts of HTML and CSS to create the website,
The first tab has an event listener, it opens an image when clicked, and the image itself has transform and transition effects when hovered upon.

awaiting your positive feedback
Sincerely,
Joshua Buthello
